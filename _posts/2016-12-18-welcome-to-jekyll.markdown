Hello! My name is Dessie DiMino and I'm a freshman at Caltech majoring
in Computer Science.  I'm originally from New York where I went to
Garden City High School.  During my time there I was the captain of 
the varsity fencing team and captain of the math team.  I also conducted
science research at SUNY Stony Brook at in the Material Science Department
on Hyaluronic Acid BioInk which was fed into a 3D printer to generate
noncytotoxic scaffolds.  Based on this research, I was named an Intel
Science Talent Search Semifinalist.  I was also the lead programmer
for a FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics team during 2012 for the "Block
Party" Challenge.  I wrote the autonomous and remote control programs 
in RobotC which I learned online through the Carnegie Melon Robotics
Academy.  I participated in the Girl Who Code Summer Immersion Program
at the Goldman Sachs location in 2014.  I later decided to start a Girls
Who Code Club in my neighborhood and had 22 girls take a 40 hour curriculum
in Scratch during the school year of 2014-2015 at my local library.  I was 
the TA for the course and acted as a liason between Girls Who Code and the
Library.  The following year, I approached the Girl Scouts of Nassau County
and held a Club with them during the 2015-2016 school year.  We had over 100
girls try to sign up for 25 spots.  I helped Girl Scouts apply for a $10,000
grant in order to buy laptops for the club and was a TA for that class as well.
This was a 40 hour curriculum as well, but it covered Python.  In both clubs,
the students created final projects of their choice.  

Courses:
In high school I took 12 APs: Computer Science, Physics B and C:Mechanic and E&M
Chemistry, Biology, Calculus BC, Statistics, Macroeconomics, English Literature
English Language and World History.  I also took finance, accounting and business law

Now, at Caltech, I am taking CS1, CS2 and CS11 and hope to take one or two
more CS classes during the spring term. I'm also taking Proof based Calculus
Physics, Chemistry, and Chem lab(solar energy) to satisfy my core requirements

Based on my experience, I believe I have a good skill set to pursue research, 
and would be interested in bioinformatics or genetics, or go into industry
and pursue finance or software engineering.
